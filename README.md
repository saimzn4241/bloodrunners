This project aims to get the blood donors in real time. Usually when there is a need for blood in hospital, 
they have databases but data may be old or the person may be be present for blood donation or not.  
So, this projects sends the notification to all the app(web as well as android) users having the same blood group as required,
and then the willing users accepts the request and inform the hospitals that they are coming.
